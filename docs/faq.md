### Why did you make this?

I personally had some issues with some of the existing mod managing options for Linux, so I decided to make my own.
I figured that a mod manager really only involves moving around some files and modifying XML, so I went with a minimal, command-line approach.
In addition, if I made it command-line only, then it would require few dependencies and likely work well on many distros.

### Why is it called "Zhalk"?

In Baldur's Gate 3, there is the character _Commander Zhalk_ near the beginning of the game, and I figured his "Commander" title fit well with this tool.
